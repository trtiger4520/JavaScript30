    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let a = '123';
    let b = a;
    console.log(a, b);
    b = 'ssss';
    console.log(a, b)
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let c = players;
    console.log(c, players);
    //c[2] = 'sssa';
    //console.log(c, players);


    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    let d = players.slice();
    d[1] = 'ssfe';
    console.log(d, players);

    let e = [...players];
    e[0] = 'ssfe';
    console.log(e, players);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    let team2 = Array.from(players);
    team2[1] = 'd1s23f1s3df1';
    console.log(players, team2);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, { aaa: 'sdfsdf', bb: 'sdf1s23fd13s1fd3s' });
    console.log(person, person2);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const personTeam = {
      person,
      log: 'loging',
      md5: 's1df231as23df123a13xcv5z131sd3z1v3zdf',
    }

    console.log(personTeam);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    //let person3 = Object.assign(personTeam);
    //let person3 = {...personTeam}; 
    //----------------------
    let person3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(personTeam));
    console.log(person3);

    person3.person.name = '87878787';

    console.log(personTeam, person3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
